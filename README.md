# Flask
Flask is a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python. It’s often called a "micro-framework" because it provides the essentials for web development without unnecessary complexity. Unlike Django, which comes with built-in features like authentication and an admin panel, Flask keeps things minimal and lets us add only what we need.
